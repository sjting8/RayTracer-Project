     * Suppose the ray intersects the current geometry at a point `vec3 point`
     * at a distance `float t`, and the unit normal vector at the intersection
     * point is `vec3 normal`. You would then insert an intersection into the
     * vector as follows:
     *
     * intersections.push_back({t, point, normal, this, nullptr});
     *
     * Note:
     * - Here we pass the Model pointer as `nullptr` because it will be
     *   populated by the Model::intersect() function call.
     * - Only add intersections that are in front of the camera, i.e.,
     *   where t > 0.
